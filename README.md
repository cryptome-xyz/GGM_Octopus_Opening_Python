# GGM-Based Octopus Opening (Python)

This repository provides a **Python implementation of the GGM-based Octopus opening**, inspired by the concept of [Compact Merkle Multiproofs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07648).

The proof generation is specifically tailored for openings in Batched All-But-One Vector Commitment (BAVC) type GGM trees ([ePrint 2024/490](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/490.pdf)).

## Status

- **Opening of GGM trees** is implemented and functional.  
- **Verification** is not yet implemented â€” planned for completion soon.

## Acknowledgements
The code is completed with the assistance of [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://openai.com/).
